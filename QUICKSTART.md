# üöÄ Quick Start Guide

Get AgentSpring running in under 5 minutes!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on textract
`textract` is currently broken on PyPI due to dependency metadata (see https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract/issues/360). It is not included in requirements.txt. If you need it, install manually:

```bash
pip install --no-deps textract==1.6.4
pip install extract-msg==0.28.7
```

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Docker Desktop** (for full stack)
- **Git** (to clone the repository)

## Step 1: Clone and Navigate
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd agentspring
```

## Step 2: Start Everything
```bash
./start.sh
```
Or run directly:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Step 3: Use a Tool Out of the Box
AgentSpring provides a registry of production-ready tools. For example, to read a file:

```python
from agentspring.tools import tool_registry
result = tool_registry.execute_tool("read_file", file_path="README.md")
print(result.result["content"])
```

## Step 4: Try Agentic Orchestration
You can use natural language to orchestrate multi-step workflows:

```python
from agentspring.orchestration import create_orchestrator
orchestrator = create_orchestrator()
result = orchestrator.execute_prompt("Read the README file, summarize it, and send the summary to Slack.")
print(result)
```

## Step 5: Verify It's Working

Wait about 2-3 minutes for everything to start, then check:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# API documentation
open http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## Step 6: Test the API

### Quick Test (Recommended)
```bash
python test_quickstart.py
```
This will run comprehensive tests to verify everything is working correctly.

### Manual Test
```bash
# Test a complaint analysis
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/analyze" \
  -H "X-API-Key: demo-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "CUST123",
    "message": "My account is locked and I need immediate access!"
  }'
```

## üåê Access Points

| Service | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| **API** | http://localhost:8000 | Main API server |
| **API Docs** | http://localhost:8000/docs | Interactive API documentation |
| **Health Check** | http://localhost:8000/health | System health status |
| **Flower Dashboard** | http://localhost:5555 | Task monitoring dashboard |
| **Ollama** | http://localhost:11434 | LLM model management |

## üîë Authentication

Use this API key for testing:
```
demo-key
```
Include it in the `X-API-Key` header with all requests.

## üìä Monitoring

```bash
# View all logs
docker-compose logs -f
```
