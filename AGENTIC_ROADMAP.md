# 🗺️ AgentSpring Agentic Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the steps to evolve AgentSpring from a prompt-driven orchestrator into a fully agentic system—one that exhibits autonomy, memory, learning, and proactive behavior.

---

## **Phase 1: Core Agentic Capabilities**

### 1. Multi-Turn Dialogue & Memory
- **Goal:** Maintain context across multiple user interactions.
- **Build:**
  - Conversation history (short-term memory)
  - Working memory for intermediate results
  - Ability to reference previous results in new prompts

### 2. Goal & Intent Management
- **Goal:** Let users specify high-level goals, not just step-by-step tasks.
- **Build:**
  - Intent recognition (what is the user trying to achieve?)
  - Goal decomposition (break goals into actionable steps)
  - Progress tracking for ongoing goals

### 3. Self-Monitoring & Reflection
- **Goal:** The agent can evaluate its own actions and outcomes.
- **Build:**
  - Step/result validation (did the output make sense?)
  - Error detection and recovery (retry, suggest alternatives)
  - Logging and self-assessment after workflows

---

## **Phase 2: Autonomy & Proactivity**

### 4. Proactive Suggestions & Actions
- **Goal:** The agent can suggest or take actions without explicit user prompts.
- **Build:**
  - Pattern recognition (detect recurring needs)
  - Scheduled or triggered workflows (e.g., "run this every morning")
  - Notifications and recommendations

### 5. Learning & Adaptation
- **Goal:** The agent improves over time.
- **Build:**
  - Learn from user feedback (thumbs up/down, corrections)
  - Adapt prompt templates and tool selection based on success/failure
  - Store and reuse successful workflow patterns

---

## **Phase 3: Advanced Agentic Features**

### 6. Conditional Logic & Branching
- **Goal:** Support "if/else", loops, and more complex logic in workflows.
- **Build:**
  - Conditional tool execution (e.g., "if validation fails, alert admin")
  - Looping over data sets (e.g., process all files in a folder)
  - Branching workflows

### 7. Multi-Agent Collaboration
- **Goal:** Multiple agents with specialized skills can collaborate.
- **Build:**
  - Agent registry and routing (send tasks to the right agent)
  - Inter-agent communication (pass results between agents)
  - Conflict resolution and consensus

### 8. Long-Term Knowledge Base
- **Goal:** The agent can remember facts, preferences, and past experiences.
- **Build:**
  - Persistent storage of user preferences, facts, and workflow outcomes
  - Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for context-aware responses

---

## **Phase 4: Enterprise-Grade Features**

### 9. Security, Permissions, and Auditing
- **Goal:** Safe, compliant, and auditable agentic actions.
- **Build:**
  - Fine-grained tool permissions and user roles
  - Audit logs for all actions and decisions
  - Approval workflows for sensitive operations

### 10. Scalability & Observability
- **Goal:** Production-ready, observable, and scalable system.
- **Build:**
  - Distributed execution and task queue integration
  - Monitoring, metrics, and alerting
  - Robust error handling and fallback strategies

---

## **Phase 5: Advanced Cognitive Capabilities**

### 11. Reasoning & Strategic Planning
- **Goal:** The agent can reason about complex scenarios and adapt strategies.
- **Build:**
  - Multi-step planning with backtracking
  - Strategy evaluation and selection
  - Dynamic plan adaptation when conditions change
  - Abstract reasoning and problem decomposition

### 12. Tool Discovery & Creation
- **Goal:** The agent can discover, understand, and create new tools.
- **Build:**
  - Tool capability understanding and documentation
  - Dynamic tool registration and discovery
  - Simple tool creation for repetitive tasks
  - Tool composition and chaining optimization

### 13. Meta-Learning & Self-Optimization
- **Goal:** The agent can improve its own behavior and learning strategies.
- **Build:**
  - Prompt template optimization
  - Learning strategy adaptation
  - Performance self-assessment and improvement
  - Hyperparameter tuning for its own models

### 14. Uncertainty & Probabilistic Reasoning
- **Goal:** Handle uncertainty and make informed decisions with incomplete information.
- **Build:**
  - Confidence scoring for decisions
  - Probabilistic tool selection
  - Clarification requests when uncertain
  - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### 15. Safety & Ethical Constraints
- **Goal:** Ensure the agent operates safely and ethically.
- **Build:**
  - Safety guardrails and constraints
  - Ethical decision-making frameworks
  - Ability to refuse harmful requests
  - Bias detection and mitigation

## Example: What "100% Agentic" Looks Like

> User: "Every Monday, download the latest sales data, validate it, and email me a summary. If there are anomalies, alert the finance team."
> 
> AgentSpring:
> - Remembers this as a recurring goal
> - Plans and executes the workflow every Monday
> - Handles errors, retries, and notifies the right people
> - Learns from feedback (e.g., "next time, also include a chart")
> - Logs all actions and can explain its decisions
> - **NEW:** Adapts the plan if the data source changes
> - **NEW:** Creates a custom validation tool if needed
> - **NEW:** Optimizes its own prompt templates based on success rates
> - **NEW:** Asks for clarification if the data format is unexpected
> - **NEW:** Refuses to share sensitive data without proper authorization
